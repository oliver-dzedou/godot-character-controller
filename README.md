# Godot Character Controller

This is a standalone plug'n'play Godot character controller suitable for platformers or metroidvanias. It includes most of the commonly used techniques and tricks to make 2D movement and camera feel good. If I had to compare it to anything, it's the most similar to Hollow Knight.

While I believe the code is readable and structured well, the project lacks documentation or tests. I don't plan to add either, so use at your own risk.

Last tested with Godot 4.4
