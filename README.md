# Godot Character Controller

This is a standalone plug'n'play Godot character controller suitable for platformers or metroidvanias

While I believe the code is readable and structured well, the project lacks documentation or tests. I don't plan to add either, so use at your own risk.

Last tested with Godot 4.4
